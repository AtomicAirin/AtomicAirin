## Hi! I'm Airin ⟨"*i*-rin"⟩.

I’m currently working on **SYNCOR** (Software for Numerical Computation and Optimization Routines), an alternative to expensive optimization software.

*SYNCOR is being developed with efficiency and usability in mind, leveraging the capabilities of Rust to achieve high performance.*
