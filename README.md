# Hi! I'm Airin ⟨"*i*-rin"⟩.

I’m currently working on **SYNCOR** (Software for Numerical Computation and Optimization Routines).

## SYNCOR

SYNCOR will be an alternative to expensive, hard-to-use commercial optimization software. It is being developed with efficiency and usability in mind, leveraging the capabilities of Rust to achieve high performance.
